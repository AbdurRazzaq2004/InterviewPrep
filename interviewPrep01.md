## **Section 1: DevOps Fundamentals & Culture (20 minutes)**

### **Q1: What is DevOps and how does it differ from traditional software development approaches?**

**Expected Answer:**
DevOps is a cultural and technical practice that bridges the gap between Development (Dev) and Operations (Ops) teams. Key differences:

**Traditional Approach:**
- Separate Dev and Ops teams with different goals
- Manual deployments and lengthy release cycles
- Limited communication between teams
- Issues discovered late in production

**DevOps Approach:**
- Collaborative culture with shared responsibility
- Automated CI/CD pipelines for faster, reliable deployments
- Continuous feedback and monitoring
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
- Early detection and resolution of issues

**Benefits:** Faster time-to-market, improved quality, better collaboration, reduced failure rates, faster recovery times.

**Follow-up Questions:**
- "Can you give me an example of how DevOps improved a process in your previous experience?"
- "What challenges have you faced when implementing DevOps practices?"

---

### **Q2: Explain the CI/CD process and the difference between Continuous Delivery and Continuous Deployment.**

**Expected Answer:**

**Continuous Integration (CI):**
- Developers frequently merge code changes into a shared repository
- Automated build, compile, and test processes
- Early detection of integration issues
- Code quality checks and security scans

**Continuous Delivery:**
- Automated deployment to staging environments
- Manual approval required for production deployment
- Ensures code is always in a deployable state
- Human decision point for release timing

**Continuous Deployment:**
- Fully automated pipeline to production
- Every successful commit automatically deployed
- No manual intervention required
- Requires robust testing and monitoring

**Real-world analogy:** CI is like preparing a gift (packaging code), CD Delivery is having the gift ready to ship but waiting for approval, CD Deployment is automatically shipping the gift immediately when ready.

## **Section 2: Version Control & Git (15 minutes)**

### **Q3: Walk me through your daily Git workflow. What commands do you use most frequently?**

**Expected Answer:**
```bash
# Daily workflow commands
git status                    # Check current state
git pull origin main         # Get latest changes
git checkout -b feature/new-feature  # Create feature branch
git add .                    # Stage changes
git commit -m "descriptive message"  # Commit with clear message
git push origin feature/new-feature  # Push feature branch
# Create Pull Request
git checkout main            # Switch back to main
git pull origin main         # Update main branch
git branch -d feature/new-feature    # Delete merged branch
```

**Additional commands:**
```bash
git log --oneline           # View commit history
git diff                    # See changes
git stash                   # Temporarily save work
git merge                   # Merge branches
git rebase                  # Rewrite history (local only)
```

---

### **Q4: What is the difference between `git merge` and `git rebase`? When would you use each?**

**Expected Answer:**

**Git Merge:**
- Creates a new merge commit
- Preserves branch history
- Non-destructive operation
- Creates a diamond-shaped history

**Git Rebase:**
- Replays commits on top of another branch
- Creates linear history
- Rewrites commit history
- Cleaner, linear timeline

**When to use:**
- **Merge:** For feature branches in team environments, when you want to preserve context
- **Rebase:** For cleaning up local commits before pushing, when you want linear history

**Important:** Never rebase shared/public branches as it rewrites history and can cause conflicts for other team members.

---

## **Section 3: Jenkins & CI/CD Implementation (25 minutes)**

## **Section 4: Docker & Containerization (20 minutes)**

### **Q9: Explain Docker architecture and the difference between images and containers.**

**Expected Answer:**

**Docker Architecture:**
- **Docker Daemon:** Background service that manages Docker objects
- **Docker Client:** Command-line interface for interacting with daemon
- **Docker Registry:** Repository for Docker images (Docker Hub, private registries)
- **Docker Images:** Read-only templates for creating containers
- **Docker Containers:** Running instances of images

**Images vs Containers:**

**Docker Image:**
- Read-only template/blueprint
- Immutable and versioned
- Contains application code, runtime, libraries, dependencies
- Built using Dockerfile
- Can be shared via registries

**Docker Container:**
- Running instance of an image
- Writable layer on top of image
- Has its own filesystem, network, and process space
- Ephemeral - can be started, stopped, destroyed
- Isolated from host and other containers

**Analogy:** Image is like a blueprint for a house, Container is the actual house built from that blueprint.

---

### **Q10: What are the essential Docker commands you use regularly?**

**Expected Answer:**

**Image Management:**
```bash
docker build -t myapp:v1.0 .          # Build image from Dockerfile
docker images                          # List local images
docker pull nginx:latest               # Pull image from registry
docker push myrepo/myapp:v1.0         # Push image to registry
docker rmi image_id                   # Remove image
docker tag source_image target_image   # Tag image
```

**Container Management:**
```bash
docker run -d -p 8080:80 nginx        # Run container in detached mode
docker ps                             # List running containers
docker ps -a                          # List all containers
docker stop container_id               # Stop container
docker start container_id              # Start stopped container
docker restart container_id            # Restart container
docker rm container_id                 # Remove container
docker logs container_id               # View container logs
docker exec -it container_id bash     # Access running container
```

**System Management:**
```bash
docker system prune                    # Clean up unused resources
docker volume ls                       # List volumes
docker network ls                      # List networks
docker info                           # Display system information
```

---

### **Q11: How do you handle data persistence and networking in Docker?**

**Expected Answer:**

**Data Persistence:**

1. **Volumes (Recommended):**
   ```bash
   docker run -v myvolume:/data nginx    # Named volume
   docker volume create myvolume         # Create volume explicitly
   docker volume ls                      # List volumes
   ```

2. **Bind Mounts:**
   ```bash
   docker run -v /host/path:/container/path nginx
   ```

3. **tmpfs Mounts:** (In-memory, temporary data)

**Networking:**

1. **Bridge Network (Default):**
   - Containers can communicate with each other
   - Isolated from host network

2. **Host Network:**
   ```bash
   docker run --network host nginx      # Use host networking
   ```

3. **Custom Networks:**
   ```bash
   docker network create mynetwork      # Create custom network
   docker run --network mynetwork nginx # Connect to custom network
   ```

4. **Port Mapping:**
   ```bash
   docker run -p 8080:80 nginx          # Map host port to container port
   ```

**Best Practices:**
- Use named volumes for persistent data
- Use custom networks for multi-container applications
- Avoid bind mounts in production
- Use Docker Compose for complex networking

## **Section 5: Kubernetes Fundamentals (25 minutes)**

### **Q12: What is Kubernetes and why do we need container orchestration?**

**Expected Answer:**

**Kubernetes:** Open-source container orchestration platform that automates deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

**Why Container Orchestration is Needed:**

**Without Orchestration:**
- Manual container management across multiple hosts
- No automatic healing when containers fail
- Difficult scaling and load balancing
- Complex networking between containers
- Manual deployment and rollback processes

**With Kubernetes:**
- **Auto-scaling:** Automatically scale applications based on CPU/memory usage
- **Self-healing:** Restart failed containers, replace unhealthy nodes
- **Load balancing:** Distribute traffic across multiple container instances
- **Service discovery:** Containers can find and communicate with each other
- **Rolling updates:** Update applications without downtime
- **Resource management:** Efficient utilization of cluster resources
- **Configuration management:** Manage secrets, config maps
- **Storage orchestration:** Automatically mount storage systems

**Key Benefits:**
- High availability and reliability
- Efficient resource utilization
- Simplified deployment and management
- Vendor agnostic (runs on any cloud or on-premises)

---

### **Q13: Explain Pods, Services, and Deployments. How do they work together?**

**Expected Answer:**

**Pod:**
- Smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes
- Contains one or more closely related containers
- Containers in a pod share network and storage
- Ephemeral - pods can be destroyed and recreated
- Each pod gets its own IP address

**Service:**
- Provides stable network access to pods
- Abstracts away pod IP changes
- Load balances traffic across multiple pods
- **Types:**
  - **ClusterIP:** Internal communication (default)
  - **NodePort:** External access via node ports (30000-32767)
  - **LoadBalancer:** Cloud provider load balancer

**Deployment:**
- Higher-level abstraction that manages ReplicaSets
- Ensures specified number of pod replicas are running
- Handles rolling updates and rollbacks
- Provides declarative updates to applications

**How They Work Together:**
1. **Deployment** creates and manages **ReplicaSets**
2. **ReplicaSet** ensures desired number of **Pods** are running
3. **Service** provides stable networking to access the **Pods**
4. **Labels and Selectors** connect Services to Pods

Example workflow:
```yaml
# Deployment creates pods
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:1.20

---
# Service exposes pods
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: nginx-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: nginx  # Matches deployment labels
  ports:
  - port: 80
    targetPort: 80
  type: ClusterIP
```

---

### **Q14: What are Kubernetes Namespaces and how do you use them effectively?**

**Expected Answer:**

**Namespaces:** Virtual clusters within a physical Kubernetes cluster that provide isolation and organization.

**Key Benefits:**
- **Resource Isolation:** Separate environments (dev, staging, prod)
- **Access Control:** Different RBAC policies per namespace
- **Resource Quotas:** Limit CPU, memory, and object counts
- **Organization:** Logical grouping of related resources
- **Name Scoping:** Same resource names can exist in different namespaces

**Default Namespaces:**
- `default` - Default namespace for objects without a specified namespace
- `kube-system` - Kubernetes system components
- `kube-public` - Publicly accessible resources
- `kube-node-lease` - Node lease objects for heartbeats

**Creating Namespaces:**
```bash
# Command line
kubectl create namespace dev

# YAML file
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: dev
```

**Using Namespaces:**
```bash
# Deploy to specific namespace
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml -n dev

# Set default namespace for context
kubectl config set-context --current --namespace=dev

# Access resources across namespaces
mysql.connect("db-service.dev.svc.cluster.local")
```

**Resource Quotas:**
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ResourceQuota
metadata:
  name: compute-quota
  namespace: dev
spec:
  hard:
    pods: "10"
    requests.cpu: "4"
    requests.memory: 5Gi
    limits.cpu: "10"
    limits.memory: 10Gi
```

**Best Practices:**
- Use namespaces for environment separation
- Implement resource quotas to prevent resource hogging
- Use consistent naming conventions
- Set up proper RBAC per namespace
- Monitor resource usage per namespace

---

### **Q15: Explain Labels and Selectors in Kubernetes. Why are they important?**

**Expected Answer:**

**Labels:** Key-value pairs attached to Kubernetes objects for identification and organization.

**Selectors:** Queries used to filter and select objects based on their labels.

**Why They're Important:**
- **Organization:** Group and categorize resources
- **Selection:** Filter objects for operations
- **Service Binding:** Connect services to pods
- **Deployment Management:** Manage which pods belong to which deployment
- **Monitoring:** Group metrics by labels

**Example Labels:**
```yaml
metadata:
  labels:
    app: frontend
    version: v1.2.3
    environment: production
    tier: web
    team: platform
```

**Types of Selectors:**

1. **Equality-based:**
   ```bash
   kubectl get pods --selector app=frontend
   kubectl get pods -l environment=production,tier=web
   ```

2. **Set-based:**
   ```bash
   kubectl get pods --selector 'environment in (production, staging)'
   kubectl get pods --selector 'tier notin (cache, database)'
   ```

**In Resource Definitions:**
```yaml
# Service selector
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
spec:
  selector:
    app: frontend    # Selects pods with app=frontend label

---
# ReplicaSet selector
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: ReplicaSet
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: frontend
    matchExpressions:
    - {key: tier, operator: In, values: [web]}
```

**Best Practices:**
- Use consistent labeling strategy across organization
- Include environment, application, version, and team labels
- Use selectors to group related resources
- Avoid changing labels on running resources
- Document your labeling conventions

**Annotations vs Labels:**
- **Labels:** For identification and selection
- **Annotations:** For non-identifying metadata (build info, contact details)

### **Q16: What is the difference between Imperative and Declarative approaches in Kubernetes?**

**Expected Answer:**

**Imperative Approach:**
- Tells Kubernetes **how** to do something
- Step-by-step instructions
- Direct commands to create/modify resources
- Good for quick tasks and learning

**Examples:**
```bash
kubectl run nginx --image=nginx
kubectl create deployment nginx --image=nginx
kubectl expose deployment nginx --port=80
kubectl scale deployment nginx --replicas=3
kubectl set image deployment nginx nginx=nginx:1.20
```

**Pros:**
- Quick and immediate
- Good for one-off tasks
- Easy to learn and understand

**Cons:**
- Not version controlled
- Difficult to reproduce
- Hard to track changes
- Risk of configuration drift

**Declarative Approach:**
- Tells Kubernetes **what** the desired state should be
- Kubernetes figures out how to achieve that state
- Configuration files (usually YAML)
- Good for production and team environments

**Examples:**
```yaml
# nginx-deployment.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:1.20
```

```bash
kubectl apply -f nginx-deployment.yaml
```

**Pros:**
- Version controlled
- Reproducible
- Self-documenting
- Enables GitOps workflows
- Better for collaboration

**Cons:**
- Requires YAML knowledge
- More setup for simple tasks

**Best Practices:**
- Use imperative for learning and quick tasks
- Use declarative for production workloads
- Store YAML files in version control
- Use `kubectl apply` instead of `create` for declarative management
- Implement GitOps workflows with declarative configurations

**Real-world analogy:**
- **Imperative:** Giving turn-by-turn directions to a destination
- **Declarative:** Entering destination in GPS and letting it find the route

## **Section 8: Scenario-Based Problem Solving (20 minutes)**

### **Q21: Your production application is down. Walk me through your incident response process.**

**Expected Answer:**

**Immediate Response (First 5 minutes):**
1. **Acknowledge the incident** - Confirm the issue and alert stakeholders
2. **Check monitoring dashboards** - Look at application and infrastructure metrics
3. **Quick health checks:**
   ```bash
   # Check if services are running
   systemctl status application
   kubectl get pods -n production
   
   # Check basic connectivity
   curl -f http://app.example.com/health
   ```

**Investigation Phase (Next 10-15 minutes):**
4. **Check recent changes:**
   - Recent deployments
   - Infrastructure changes
   - Configuration updates
   
5. **Analyze logs:**
   ```bash
   # Application logs
   tail -f /var/log/application/app.log
   journalctl -u application --since "30 minutes ago"
   
   # System logs
   tail -f /var/log/syslog | grep ERROR
   
   # Container logs
   kubectl logs -f deployment/app -n production
   ```

6. **Check system resources:**
   ```bash
   # CPU, Memory, Disk
   top
   free -h
   df -h
   
   # Network connectivity
   netstat -tulpn
   ping database.example.com
   ```

**Resolution Phase:**
7. **Implement immediate fix:**
   - Rollback to previous version if deployment issue
   - Restart services if resource issue
   - Scale up if capacity issue
   
   ```bash
   # Rollback deployment
   kubectl rollout undo deployment/app -n production
   
   # Scale up pods
   kubectl scale deployment app --replicas=5 -n production
   ```

**Post-Resolution:**
8. **Verify recovery** - Confirm application is working
9. **Monitor closely** - Watch for recurring issues
10. **Document incident** - Timeline, root cause, resolution
11. **Schedule post-mortem** - Identify improvements

**Communication:**
- Keep stakeholders updated every 15-30 minutes
- Use incident management tools (PagerDuty, Opsgenie)
- Clear, concise status updates

**Follow-up:**
- Conduct blameless post-mortem
- Implement preventive measures
- Update runbooks and documentation

### **Q22: How would you set up monitoring for a new web application?**

**Expected Answer:**

**1. Define Monitoring Strategy:**

**Infrastructure Metrics:**
- CPU, Memory, Disk, Network utilization
- System load and process counts
- File system space and inodes

**Application Metrics:**
- Response time and latency (p50, p95, p99)
- Request rate (requests per second)
- Error rate (4xx, 5xx responses)
- Database connection pool usage
- Custom business metrics

**2. Monitoring Stack Setup:**

**Metrics Collection (Prometheus + Grafana):**
```yaml
# Prometheus config
global:
  scrape_interval: 15s

scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'web-app'
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['app:8080']
    metrics_path: '/metrics'
    scrape_interval: 30s

  - job_name: 'node-exporter'
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['node1:9100', 'node2:9100']
```

**Logging (ELK Stack):**
```yaml
# Filebeat config for log shipping
filebeat.inputs:
- type: log
  enabled: true
  paths:
    - /var/log/application/*.log
  fields:
    app: web-app
    env: production

output.elasticsearch:
  hosts: ["elasticsearch:9200"]
```

**3. Application Instrumentation:**
```python
# Example Python Flask app with metrics
from prometheus_client import Counter, Histogram, generate_latest

REQUEST_COUNT = Counter('http_requests_total', 'Total HTTP requests', ['method', 'endpoint'])
REQUEST_LATENCY = Histogram('http_request_duration_seconds', 'HTTP request latency')

@app.route('/metrics')
def metrics():
    return generate_latest()

@app.before_request
def before_request():
    request.start_time = time.time()

@app.after_request
def after_request(response):
    REQUEST_COUNT.labels(method=request.method, endpoint=request.endpoint).inc()
    REQUEST_LATENCY.observe(time.time() - request.start_time)
    return response
```

**4. Alerting Rules:**
```yaml
# Prometheus alerting rules
groups:
- name: web-app-alerts
  rules:
  - alert: HighErrorRate
    expr: rate(http_requests_total{status=~"5.."}[5m]) > 0.1
    for: 5m
    annotations:
      summary: "High error rate detected"
      
  - alert: HighLatency
    expr: histogram_quantile(0.95, rate(http_request_duration_seconds_bucket[5m])) > 0.5
    for: 5m
    annotations:
      summary: "High latency detected"
      
  - alert: ServiceDown
    expr: up{job="web-app"} == 0
    for: 1m
    annotations:
      summary: "Web application is down"
```

**5. Dashboards:**
- **Executive Dashboard:** High-level KPIs, SLA metrics
- **Operational Dashboard:** Detailed metrics for troubleshooting
- **Infrastructure Dashboard:** System resource utilization

**6. Health Checks:**
```bash
# Application health endpoint
curl -f http://app.example.com/health

# Database connectivity check
curl -f http://app.example.com/health/db

# Dependency checks
curl -f http://app.example.com/health/dependencies
```

**7. Synthetic Monitoring:**
- External uptime monitoring (Pingdom, StatusPage)
- Automated user journey testing
- API endpoint monitoring

**8. On-call Setup:**
- PagerDuty/Opsgenie integration
- Escalation policies
- Runbooks for common issues
- Contact rotation schedules

### **Q23: Describe how you would implement a Blue-Green deployment strategy.**

**Expected Answer:**

**Blue-Green Deployment Overview:**
A deployment strategy where you maintain two identical production environments (Blue and Green), with only one serving traffic at a time.

**Implementation Steps:**

**1. Infrastructure Setup:**
```yaml
# Blue environment (current production)
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: app-blue
  labels:
    version: blue
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: myapp
      version: blue
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: myapp
        version: blue
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: app
        image: myapp:v1.0
        
---
# Green environment (new version)
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: app-green
  labels:
    version: green
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: myapp
      version: green
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: myapp
        version: green
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: app
        image: myapp:v2.0
```

**2. Load Balancer/Service Configuration:**
```yaml
# Service that can switch between blue and green
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: app-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: myapp
    version: blue  # Initially pointing to blue
  ports:
  - port: 80
    targetPort: 8080
```

**3. Deployment Process:**

**Phase 1: Deploy to Green Environment**
```bash
# Update green deployment with new version
kubectl set image deployment/app-green app=myapp:v2.0

# Wait for deployment to complete
kubectl rollout status deployment/app-green

# Verify green environment health
kubectl get pods -l version=green
kubectl logs -f deployment/app-green
```

**Phase 2: Testing Green Environment**
```bash
# Create temporary service for testing
kubectl patch service app-service -p '{"spec":{"selector":{"version":"green"}}}'

# Run smoke tests
curl -f http://green-test.example.com/health
./run-integration-tests.sh --env=green

# Load testing (optional)
ab -n 1000 -c 10 http://green-test.example.com/
```

**Phase 3: Switch Traffic (Go-Live)**
```bash
# Switch service to green environment
kubectl patch service app-service -p '{"spec":{"selector":{"version":"green"}}}'

# Monitor application metrics closely
kubectl logs -f deployment/app-green
# Check monitoring dashboards for error rates, latency
```

**Phase 4: Cleanup or Rollback**
```bash
# If successful, cleanup blue environment
kubectl delete deployment app-blue

# If issues occur, rollback to blue
kubectl patch service app-service -p '{"spec":{"selector":{"version":"blue"}}}'
```

**4. Jenkins Pipeline Implementation:**
```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any
    
    stages {
        stage('Determine Current Environment') {
            steps {
                script {
                    def current = sh(
                        script: "kubectl get service app-service -o jsonpath='{.spec.selector.version}'",
                        returnStdout: true
                    ).trim()
                    
                    env.CURRENT_ENV = current
                    env.TARGET_ENV = current == "blue" ? "green" : "blue"
                    
                    echo "Current: ${env.CURRENT_ENV}, Target: ${env.TARGET_ENV}"
                }
            }
        }
        
        stage('Deploy to Target Environment') {
            steps {
                sh "kubectl set image deployment/app-${env.TARGET_ENV} app=myapp:${env.BUILD_NUMBER}"
                sh "kubectl rollout status deployment/app-${env.TARGET_ENV}"
            }
        }
        
        stage('Run Tests') {
            steps {
                sh "./run-smoke-tests.sh ${env.TARGET_ENV}"
                sh "./run-integration-tests.sh ${env.TARGET_ENV}"
            }
        }
        
        stage('Switch Traffic') {
            steps {
                input message: 'Deploy to Production?', ok: 'Deploy'
                sh "kubectl patch service app-service -p '{\"spec\":{\"selector\":{\"version\":\"${env.TARGET_ENV}\"}}}}'"
            }
        }
        
        stage('Verify Deployment') {
            steps {
                sh "sleep 30"  // Wait for traffic to stabilize
                sh "./verify-production-health.sh"
            }
        }
    }
    
    post {
        failure {
            // Rollback on failure
            sh "kubectl patch service app-service -p '{\"spec\":{\"selector\":{\"version\":\"${env.CURRENT_ENV}\"}}}}'"
        }
    }
}
```

**5. Advantages:**

## **Section 9: Infrastructure as Code & Cloud (10 minutes)**

### **Q24: What is Infrastructure as Code and what tools have you used?**

**Expected Answer:**

**Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** The practice of managing and provisioning infrastructure through machine-readable configuration files rather than manual processes or interactive configuration tools.

**Key Benefits:**
- **Version Control:** Track infrastructure changes like code
- **Reproducibility:** Create identical environments consistently
- **Automation:** Reduce manual errors and time
- **Documentation:** Infrastructure is self-documenting
- **Collaboration:** Team can review and contribute to infrastructure
- **Cost Management:** Tear down and recreate environments easily

**Popular IaC Tools:**

**1. Terraform:**
```hcl
# Example Terraform configuration
resource "aws_instance" "web_server" {
  ami           = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1d0"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
  
  tags = {
    Name = "WebServer"
    Environment = "Production"
  }
}

resource "aws_security_group" "web_sg" {
  name_prefix = "web-"
  
  ingress {
    from_port   = 80
    to_port     = 80
    protocol    = "tcp"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  }
}
```

**2. Ansible:**
```yaml
# Ansible playbook
- name: Configure web servers
  hosts: web_servers
  become: yes
  
  tasks:
    - name: Install nginx
      apt:
        name: nginx
        state: present
        
    - name: Start nginx service
      service:
        name: nginx
        state: started
        enabled: yes
```

**3. Cloud-Specific Tools:**
- **AWS CloudFormation:** AWS native IaC
- **Azure ARM Templates:** Azure Resource Manager templates
- **Google Cloud Deployment Manager:** GCP infrastructure deployment

**4. Configuration Management:**
- **Chef:** Ruby-based configuration management
- **Puppet:** Declarative configuration management
- **SaltStack:** Python-based automation

**Best Practices:**
- Store IaC code in version control
- Use modular, reusable components
- Implement proper testing (validation, linting)
- Use separate environments (dev, staging, prod)
- Implement state management and locking
- Document dependencies and prerequisites

---

### **Q25: How do you manage different environments (dev, staging, production) with IaC?**

**Expected Answer:**

**Environment Management Strategies:**

**1. Directory Structure Approach:**
```
terraform/
├── environments/
│   ├── dev/
│   │   ├── main.tf
│   │   ├── variables.tf
│   │   └── terraform.tfvars
│   ├── staging/
│   │   ├── main.tf
│   │   ├── variables.tf
│   │   └── terraform.tfvars
│   └── production/
│       ├── main.tf
│       ├── variables.tf
│       └── terraform.tfvars
└── modules/
    ├── networking/
    ├── compute/
    └── database/
```

**2. Environment-Specific Variables:**
```hcl
# variables.tf
variable "environment" {
  description = "Environment name"
  type        = string
}

variable "instance_size" {
  description = "EC2 instance size"
  type        = map(string)
  default = {
    dev        = "t2.micro"
    staging    = "t2.small"
    production = "t3.large"
  }
}

variable "replica_count" {
  description = "Number of replicas"
  type        = map(number)
  default = {
    dev        = 1
    staging    = 2
    production = 5
  }
}
```

**3. Environment Configuration Files:**
```hcl
# dev/terraform.tfvars
environment = "dev"
vpc_cidr = "10.1.0.0/16"
enable_monitoring = false
backup_retention = 7

# production/terraform.tfvars
environment = "production"
vpc_cidr = "10.100.0.0/16"
enable_monitoring = true
backup_retention = 30
```

**4. Kubernetes Environment Management:**
```yaml
# Using Helm charts with values files
# values-dev.yaml
replicaCount: 1
resources:
  limits:
    cpu: 100m
    memory: 128Mi
  
# values-prod.yaml
replicaCount: 5
resources:
  limits:
    cpu: 500m
    memory: 512Mi
```

**5. Deployment Pipeline:**
```yaml
# GitLab CI example
stages:
  - validate
  - plan
  - apply

variables:
  TF_ROOT: ${CI_PROJECT_DIR}/terraform

.terraform_template: &terraform_template
  image: hashicorp/terraform:latest
  before_script:
    - cd ${TF_ROOT}/environments/${ENVIRONMENT}
    - terraform init

validate:
  <<: *terraform_template
  stage: validate
  script:
    - terraform validate
    - terraform fmt -check

plan_dev:
  <<: *terraform_template
  stage: plan
  variables:
    ENVIRONMENT: dev
  script:
    - terraform plan -out=plan.tfplan
  artifacts:
    paths:
      - ${TF_ROOT}/environments/dev/plan.tfplan
    expire_in: 1 week

apply_dev:
  <<: *terraform_template
  stage: apply
  variables:
    ENVIRONMENT: dev
  script:
    - terraform apply plan.tfplan
  dependencies:
    - plan_dev
  when: manual
```

**6. State Management:**
```hcl
# Backend configuration for different environments
terraform {
  backend "s3" {
    bucket         = "company-terraform-state"
    key            = "environments/dev/terraform.tfstate"
    region         = "us-west-2"
    encrypt        = true
    dynamodb_table = "terraform-state-lock"
  }
}
```

**Best Practices:**
- **Separate State Files:** Each environment has its own state
- **Environment Promotion:** Deploy to dev → staging → production
- **Automated Testing:** Validate infrastructure before applying
- **Access Control:** Different permissions per environment
- **Monitoring:** Track changes and drift detection
- **Backup Strategy:** Regular state backups and recovery procedures

**GitOps Approach:**
- Use Git branches for environment management
- Automated deployment from Git commits
- Pull-based deployment with ArgoCD/Flux
- Infrastructure changes through Pull Requests
